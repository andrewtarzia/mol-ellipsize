  abstract = {The metal\textendash organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 (ZIF-8=zeolitic imidazolate framework-8) was evaluated as molecular sieve membrane in the pervaporation of the two liquid mixtures n-hexane/benzene and n-hexane/mesitylene. Though it is known from permeation studies of light gases that ZIF-8 membranes show no sharp separation cut-off at the estimated crystallographic pore size of 3.4\AA, highly branched or aromatic hydrocarbons{$>$}C5 could be expected therefore to become rejected by the ZIF-8 pores thus remaining in the retentate. However, the ZIF-8 membrane shows for n-hexane and benzene remarkable fluxes. Under consideration of the leakage of the apparatus, we can state that n-hexane and benzene can pass the ZIF-8 membrane. Benzene had a lower flux than n-hexane, whereas for mesitylene we could only observe a very small leakage rate through the O-ring gasket. Correspondingly, medium mixture separation factors have been found for the pervaporation separation of a liquid n-hexane/benzene mixture. Additional mixed gas hydrogen/methane separations, adsorption experiments and leak rate measurements were carried out to evaluate the results.},

  abstract = {Accurate and efficient predictions of hydrocarbon diffusivities in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are challenging, due to the small pore size of materials such as ZIF-8 and the wide range of diffusion time scales of hydrocarbon molecules in ZIFs. Here we have computationally measured the hopping rates of 15 different molecules (kinetic diameters of 2.66\textendash 5.10 \AA ) in ZIF-8 via dynamically corrected transition state theory (dcTST). Umbrella sampling combined with the one-dimensional weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) was used to calculate the diffusion free energy barriers. Both the umbrella sampling and dynamical correction calculations included ZIF-8 flexibility, which is found to be critical in accurately describing molecular diffusion in this material. Comparison of the computed diffusivities to extant experimental results shows remarkable agreement within an order of magnitude for all the molecules. The dcTST method was also applied to study the effect of hydrocarbon loadings. Self and transport diffusion coefficients of methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, n-butane, and 1-butene in ZIF-8 are reported over a temperature range of 0\textendash 150 \textdegree C and loadings from infinite dilution to liquid-like loadings.},

  abstract = {Adsorptive separation is very important in industry. Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents. With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas separation, adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found. Metal\textendash organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-containing nodes connected by organic bridges, are such a new type of porous materials. They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas separations due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability. This critical review starts with a brief introduction to gas separation and purification based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs. Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions observed in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed. As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable molecular sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated. In addition to the experimental aspect, theoretical investigations from adsorption equilibrium to diffusion dynamics via molecular simulations are also briefly reviewed. Furthermore, gas separations in MOFs, including the molecular sieving effect, kinetic separation, the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 separation, and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 references).},

Here we report a novel method, inspired by natural biomineralization processes, which provides unprecedented protection of biomacromolecules by encapsulating them within a class of porous materials termed metal-organic frameworks. We show that proteins, enzymes and DNA rapidly induce the formation of protective metal-organic framework coatings under physiological conditions by concentrating the framework building blocks and facilitating crystallization around the biomacromolecules. The resulting biocomposite is stable under conditions that would normally decompose many biological macromolecules. For example, urease and horseradish peroxidase protected within a metal-organic framework shell are found to retain bioactivity after being treated at 80 \textdegree C and boiled in dimethylformamide (153 \textdegree C), respectively. This rapid, low-cost biomimetic mineralization process gives rise to new possibilities for the exploitation of biomacromolecules.},

From helium (2.6 \AA ) to iso-C4H10 (5.0 \AA ), the corrected diffusivity drops 14 orders of magnitude. Our results further suggest that the effective aperture size of ZIF-8 for molecular sieving is in the range of 4.0 to 4.2 \AA, which is significantly larger than the XRD-derived value (3.4 \AA ) and between the well-known aperture size of zeolite 4A (3.8 \AA ) and 5A (4.3 \AA ). Interestingly, because of aperture flexibility, the studied C4 hydrocarbon molecules that are larger than this effective aperture size still adsorb in the micropores of ZIF-8 with kinetic selectivities for iso-C4H8/iso-C4H10 of 180 and n-C4H10/iso-C4H10 of 2.5 \texttimes{} 106. These unexpected molecular sieving properties open up new opportunities for ZIF materials for separations that cannot be economically achieved by traditional microporous adsorbents such as synthetic zeolites.},

The prospects for using ZIF-8 in biofuel recovery and hydrocarbon separations are discussed in terms of adsorption or kinetic selectivities. ZIF-8 shows extremely low water vapor uptakes and is especially suitable for vapor phase butanol-based biofuel recovery. The extraordinary framework flexibility of ZIF-8 is demonstrated by the adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules that are much larger than its nominal pore size, such as m-xylene, o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. The calculation of corrected diffusion coefficients reveals an interesting spectrum of promising kinetic hydrocarbon separations by ZIF-8. These findings confirm that a molecular sieving effect tends to occur in the sorbate molecular size range of 4\textendash 6 \AA{} rather than around the nominal ZIF-8 pore size of 3.4 \AA, due to its surprising framework flexibility.},

  abstract = {Pore volumes, accessible surface areas, and the thermodynamics of adsorption are essential in the understanding of solid surface characteristics fundamental to catalyst and adsorbent screening and selection. The recently developed Multiple Equilibrium Analysis (MEA) provides a thorough characterization of the adsorption process. Molecular properties such as molecular volumes and projected molecular areas are needed in order to convert moles adsorbed to surface volumes and probe dependent, accessible surface areas. These molecular quantities are also needed in conventional methods for determining areas and pore volumes. Generally, these molecular properties have been estimated from bulk properties, but many assumptions are required. As a result, different literature values are employed for these essential molecular properties. In this article, molecular structures for various conformers of many molecules are calculated using ZINDO. Molecular volumes and excluded molecular areas are determined from these structures and tabulated for a variety of molecules. Molecular dimensions of molecules are another important consideration needed to understand molecular exclusion as well as size and shape selectivity. Molecular dimensions along the symmetry axes are tabulated as well as the two smallest minimum dimensions of each molecule. Examples are presented to illustrate the use of these quantities in shape and size selectivity, molecular exclusion, diffusion, and adsorbent selection.},

  abstract = {Small organic molecules are often flexible, i.e., they can adopt a variety of low-energy conformations in solution that exist in equilibrium with each other. Two main search strategies are used to generate representative conformational ensembles for molecules: systematic and stochastic. In the first approach, each rotatable bond is sampled systematically in discrete intervals, limiting its use to molecules with a small number of rotatable bonds. Stochastic methods, on the other hand, sample the conformational space of a molecule randomly and can thus be applied to more flexible molecules. Different methods employ different degrees of experimental data for conformer generation. So-called knowledge-based methods use predefined libraries of torsional angles and ring conformations. In the distance geometry approach, on the other hand, a smaller amount of empirical information is used, i.e., ideal bond lengths, ideal bond angles, and a few ideal torsional angles. Distance geometry is a computationally fast method to generate conformers, but it has the downside that purely distance-based constraints tend to lead to distorted aromatic rings and sp2 centers. To correct this, the resulting conformations are often minimized with a force field, adding computational complexity and run time. Here we present an alternative strategy that combines the distance geometry approach with experimental torsion-angle preferences obtained from small-molecule crystallographic data. The torsional angles are described by a previously developed set of hierarchically structured SMARTS patterns. The new approach is implemented in the open-source cheminformatics library RDKit, and its performance is assessed by comparing the diversity of the generated ensemble and the ability to reproduce crystal conformations taken from the crystal structures of small molecules and protein\textendash ligand complexes.},
